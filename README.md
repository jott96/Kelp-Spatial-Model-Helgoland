# Kelp Spatial Model Helgoland

This repository contains the different scripts that I used to model the distribution of L. hyperborea seabed cover in the coastal waters around the island of Heligoland. 
The scripts were used to conduct my master thesis "Enhancing Common Species Distribution Models for Laminaria hyperborea using Predictive Variables Derived from Remote Sensing Data:
A Case Study at the Island of Helgoland"
